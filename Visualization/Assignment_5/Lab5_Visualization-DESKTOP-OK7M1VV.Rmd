Analysis: 

Properties of watch that are mentioned mostly- > great, huge, right for the price, has a low battery life, digital watch, water resistant

Satisfied customers talking about -> comfortable, its durability, its adaptiveness, perfect for the price, has plenty of digital features, can be viewable at night, good looks.

Unsatisfied customers talking about -> terrible battery life, random non-functionality, improper time keeping,
replacement of battery and circuit, returns on the product are high.

Good and bad properties of the watch mentioned by both groups -> Brand name(Casio) is one common theme
Good -> Great looks, right for the price, comfortable, simple, clear LCD display, is of a big size, water resistant, made of metal, years of service, ease of replacement. 

Bad -> Bad battery life and requiring replacements, stops working frequently, poor luminosity, useless display.

Watch Characterisitics -> Clear LCD display, Water resistant, Digital display, Alarm, Stop watch, Dual time

### Assignment 2

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
olive_data <- read.csv("olive.csv")
olive_data <- olive_data[,-1]
olive_data$Region <- factor(olive_data$Region, levels = c(1,2,3))
shared_olive <- SharedData$new(olive_data)

```

### 1. Interactive Scatter Plot eicosenoic against linoleic
```{r}
scatter_olive <- shared_olive %>% plot_ly() %>% add_markers(x = ~eicosenoic
                                                  ,y = ~linoleic, color = I("blue"))
scatter_olive
```

Analysis: The observations at the bottom of the plot are outliers (low values of eicosenoic), these have Eicosenoic values of 1, 2 and 3.


### 2. Linking bar chart to Scatter Plot eicosenoic against linoleic
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

scatter_eico_lino = plot_ly(shared_olive, x = ~linoleic, y = ~eicosenoic) %>%
  add_markers(color = I("black"))

bar_region <- plot_ly(shared_olive, x = ~Region) %>% 
  add_histogram() %>% layout(barmode = "overlay")

subplot(scatter_eico_lino, bar_region, titleX = TRUE, titleY = TRUE) %>%
  highlight(on = "plotly_select", dynamic = T, persistent = T, opacityDim = I(1)) %>% 
  hide_legend() %>%
  layout(title = "Scatterplot: Eicosenoic vs Linoleic, Histogram: Region")
```
![](fig1.png)


Analysis: The interaction operators used here are: Level of details since the bar chart can be used to identify region. The additional relationship here is that the low values all belong to region 2 and 3.

### 3. eicosenoic against linoleic and arachidic against linolenic
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

sctr_eico_lino = plot_ly(shared_olive, x = ~linoleic, y = ~eicosenoic) %>%
  add_markers(color = I("black"))

sctr_arac_lino = plot_ly(shared_olive, x = ~linolenic, y = ~arachidic) %>%
  add_markers(color = I("black"))

subplot(sctr_eico_lino, sctr_arac_lino, titleX = TRUE, titleY = TRUE) %>%
  highlight(on = "plotly_select", dynamic = T, persistent = T, opacityDim = I(1)) %>% 
  hide_legend() %>%
  layout(title = "Scatterplots: Eicosenoic vs Linoleic, Arachidic vs Linolenic")
```
 ![](fig5.png)

Analysis: Points that are also at the bottom of the Eicosenoic Vs. Linoleic plot which are the outliers. Also two points which are greater then 1400 in Linoleic scale are also outliers in both plots which are not grouped.


### 4. Parallel coordinate plot, a linked 3d-scatter plot and linked bar chart 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

parcoord <- olive_data %>% ggparcoord(columns = c(3:10),scale = 'uniminmax')

sh_parcood <- SharedData$new(d_parcood, key = ~.ID, group = "olive")
parcoord4 <- sh_parcood %>% plot_ly(x = ~variable, y = ~value, color = I("slategray3")) %>% add_lines(
line = list(width = 0.4)) %>% add_markers(marker=list(size=0.3), text=~.ID, hoverinfo="text")

olive2=olive_data
olive2$.ID=1:nrow(olive_data)
d2<-SharedData$new(olive2, ~.ID, group="olive")
p2<-plot_ly(d2, x=~factor(Region) )%>%add_histogram()%>%layout(title = "Region",barmode="overlay")
```

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

ButtonsX=list()
for (i in 3:10){
  ButtonsX[[i-2]]= list(method = "restyle",
                        args = list( "x", list(olive_data[[i]])),
                        label = colnames(olive_data)[i])
}

  ButtonsY[[i-2]]= list(method = "restyle",
                        args = list( "y", list(olive_data[[i]])),
                        label = colnames(olive_data)[i])
}

                        args = list( "z", list(olive_data[[i]])),
                        label = colnames(olive_data)[i])
}


p3 <- plot_ly(d2, x = ~eicosenoic, y= ~linoleic, z = ~arachidic, alpha = 0.8) %>%
  add_markers() %>%
  layout(xaxis=list(title=""), yaxis=list(title=""), zaxis=list(title=""),
         title = "Select variable:",
         updatemenus = list(

           list(y=0.85, buttons = ButtonsY),
           list(y=0.70, buttons = ButtonsZ)
         )  )

bscols(parcoord4%>%highlight(on="plotly_select", dynamic=T, persistent = T, opacityDim = I(1))%>%
         hide_legend(),
       p3%>%highlight(on="plotly_click", dynamic=T, persistent = T)%>%hide_legend(),
       p2%>%highlight(on="plotly_click", dynamic=T, persistent = T)%>%hide_legend())

```

Analysis:

Eicosenoic, Linoleic, Oleic seems to be most influential variables if one wants to differentitate between the regions.
Eicosenoic can surely be used to differentiate between North region and non-North region accurately.
Linoleic and Oleic help to differentiate South and Sardinia Island.


Coloring the lines in the parallel coordinate plots with regions, it is easier to spot the trends/clusters. But without the coloring. Within the South region, we see that there are 2 clusters of trends which are observed based on linoleic, stearic and oleic values. There is one group which has higher linoleic and stearic values and lower oleic values as compared to the other group.

### 5. Analysis of 4.


The interaction operators used are:

Selection operator- Attribute space, Connection operator- Data value space, Navigation operator- Screen space, Reconfiguring operator- Data value space, Encoding operator- Data value space

We chose the region by brushing and connected observations were showed on parallel coordinate plot. Re configuring operator is used when we are selecting variables for the 3D scatter plot.

Strategy for better analysis: Coloring by region, this allows to understand the hierarchical clusters in the data. Multiple Linked scatter plots (per region) are excellent to see outliers and allow to see for correleations above different variables. Finally using these both using them on a 3D scatter plot seems to provide an excellent insight.

Applying that statergy leads to the following: Region 1 can be discovered easily by higher level of Eicosenoic.
Levels of Oleic can be used to discover Region 3. Region two is the remains points
