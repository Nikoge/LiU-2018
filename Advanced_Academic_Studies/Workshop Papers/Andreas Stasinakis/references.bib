@article{Prokou2013,
abstract = {This article argues that, in Greek higher education policies of the 2000s, "equality of educational opportunities" is not given as much importance as in the 1980s and the 1990s, when higher education had been massively expanded. In the 2000s, the issue of equity is giving way to that of efficiency/quality, in accordance with a neoliberal rationale in higher education policies in Greece. The interest of the state is in economic efficiency and the "output" of higher education and thus, the state starts exerting control from a distance, reducing expenditure on higher education, individualising the responsibility for education, and trying to formulate the so-called "entrepreneurial university". Such developments are directly related to the unwillingness of governments to finance the universities, as public institutions, in the framework of the withdrawal from the welfare state.},
