Hej! A few comments to fix:


1.3) This is getting weird results. Your test statistic for the whole data is negative, however you find a distribution that is centered on 0 with the bootstrap (and the plot above shows there is a negative trend), this is very weird. The concept is that t<0 implies a curve going down and negative correlation, like the one you plotted above and you want to see how often the opposite occurs when bootstrapping for the p-value. Finding something so perfectly close to 0 (and p=0.5) would imply a horizontal line. Your p-value should be around 0.05 in the end.


1.4) There is something wrong with your permutation test too, it is too high. I would start checking if you are doing it two sided (one sided is not enough here). You p-value should be around 0.09 in the end.


1.5) This result will change when you change the other stuff, but you should report the power in the end. It should be close to 1.


Fixing these two issued should be enough. The rest of the lab seems to be fine.
